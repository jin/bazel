# Managing Maven dependencies in Android apps

In this tutorial, you will learn how to manage Maven dependencies in your
Android app with `rules_jvm_external`.

## Getting started

We will be using a completed Android app skeleton from the first tutorial on
[building an Android app](./android-app.md).

```
git clone git@github.com:bazelbuild/examples.git bazel-examples
cd bazel-examples/android/maven-dependencies
```

For the rest of the tutorial, you will be executing commands in this directory.
